## Assignment
Troubleshooting and Exception Handling: Programming Beyond Expected Results

## Moudle 4 Exceptions, Logging and Debugging
Exception handling is like a safety net for our program. It helps prevent the program from crashing when unexpected things happen.When we write code, we expect certain errors or problems to occur. With exception handling, we can tell our program what to do if it encounters these errors. Instead of crashing, the program can handle the error and continue running.

Logging is like keeping a journal for our program. It helps us to understand what the program is doing and diagnose problems when they occur.we can add log messages to our code at important points, such as when the program starts, encounters an error, or finishes running. These messages are recorded in a log file, which we can access and review later to understand what happened during the program's execution.

 Debugging is like going over our code. It helps us find and fix errors or bugs in the program.When the program doesn't behave as expected, we can use debugging tools to inspect the state of our program at different points during execution. we can examine variables, step through our code line by line, and identify where things went wrong.

 ## Code Modification:
  Added exception handling to handle cases where the input file cannot be located. 

## Code Modification:
Added data validation for transaction types and transaction amounts to ensure that only valid transactions are processed. Invalid records are collected and stored separately for further analysis.
